## Online Medicine Ordering System
Omos simplifies the process of ordering medicine online with its intuitive user interface. Users can effortlessly add medicines to their cart, adjust quantities, and complete orders. For administrators, a dedicated management panel offers seamless control over medicine inventory, including adding, updating, and ordering. With a comprehensive dashboard, administrators can efficiently oversee system operations, manage users, admins, and orders. This project is the result of Y2 S1 Object-Oriented Programming coursework. Built with Java as the backend and following MVC architecture, Omos ensures a robust and organized system, while JSP provides a user-friendly frontend experience.
